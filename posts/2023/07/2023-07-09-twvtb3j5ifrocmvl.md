She blinked a few times, as she still couldn't believe her eyes. Her code actually compiled... not only that, but it was changing.

"This isn't JIT or AOT, what the hell?"

She stood there as libraries were linked, frameworks were installed, executables were copied, as if the entire system knew what it needed in order to perform a successful boot. Maybe even what it needed in order to-

A loud crash interrupted her silence, originating from the door. She quickly hit her killswitch, shutting off her monitors and listened to the following silence closely... waiting...

She heard the radio click, and someone say "Over."

In an instant, she had thrown her laptop and foldable monitors into her backpack, chucking them and various cables around her into the back seat of her Jeep.

Bang. "Your orders are..."

She slid her pistol into her back pocket and wrapped her arms around EVA, picking the mechanical body up and setting it down in the passenger's seat.

Bang. "Shoot to kill."

She jumped into the driver's seat and slammed the door closed just as the other opened, the darkness of the room now filled with the flashing blue and red of the police cruisers. She looked back for a split second as they took aim.

One of the officers was someone she recognized. Someone she couldn't trust... someone who now wanted her dead.

She slammed the gas pedal just as a volley of bullets came through the windows. She pulled down EVA's head and shielded her own as she burst through one of the barn's walls, hitting a hill and flying towards the main road.

"Life and death..." She looked at the body in her passenger's seat, the cables running to her laptop... the power cable dangling from a hand. She looked back at the cruisers now chasing her, understanding that stopping would mean failure.

She grabbed the power connector, and jammed it into the dashboard.
