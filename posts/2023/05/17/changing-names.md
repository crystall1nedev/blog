# Figuring out my real name.

So, for the past few days or so, I've been wondering if I made the right choice on something important.

My name.

The reason I chose Eilionoir is because my sibling picked out a bunch of names, shoved them into a list, and gave me those options. They had some nice backgrounds to them, but I'm not sure if I really chose the one that fit me.

So I spent a little bit of time doing some looking into that. It was only a little bit though, and didn't really become much of a serious thing until yesterday, when my mother and said sibling asked about my name.

I told them that maybe Eilionoir wasn't going to be the final thing, and they were eager to help me figure a good one out.

One of the names they mentioned really caught my eye. And it actually has a bit of a funny story to it.

I have a total of five siblings, but we're only going to discuss the youngest two. When my mother was pregnant with us, she had guessed that us three would have been the opposite gender before being born. It was pretty funny because she was wrong every single time on that, but not really because of how two of those kids are now transgender.

The reason this is relevant is because the name that I liked was the one I was supposed to have if I was born as a girl.

Eva.

Pronounced like Ava, it's a name we've used in the family for a while now. I'm not sure what exactly drew me to the name, if I'm being honest. Maybe it's because of how short and sweet it is. Easy to pronounce so people don't constantly get it wrong which happens... a lot. (Especially with my online username, where people say "crystal-one-ne-dev". I know it's weird to have a 1 there but come on, that's just dumb.)

It's also just a cute name, even though it's pretty common. Perhaps that's why it's so common :3

I'm also thinking about continuing the tradition to take my mother's last name - it's something all of the women of the family do. Eva fits well with Luna anyway, doesn't it?

I'm really not sure what I should be saying here, other than that I'm choosing a new name that should fit better with who I am in the long run. Maybe when I'm a little more collected I'll be able to properly do this post, or maybe realize that this is enough.

I'm just excited to be Eva Luna now.
