# Bye, Reddit. I'm not sorry.

I'm not really sure what to say here. It's not a unwelcome ending to a few years of being on the platform, not anymore, at least.

I never really ventured on Reddit unless I had to. Maybe for the occasional meme or r/hackintosh post. I'm a moderator in r/PojavLauncher too, but I don't really do much because it's usually self-sustaining there. In the end I've never really... had a reason to be there, other than to look.

I remember hearing that Reddit was a platform built on its users - and that's not untrue. Subreddits are user based and run by not-Reddit-affiliated moderators. That's why Redditors can protest with blackouts to changes... such as this.

Reddit changing their API pricing - that in itself isn't a problem. But the amount they are asking for? It just seems like the move that Twitter made to force you into their app, their ads, their shit. I use Apollo every time I browse Reddit - I even dumped it and side loaded it onto my Mac too! And now... they're taking it away.

And not only that, but they don't have the maturity to understand why people are upset, and they don't have the decency to try and come up with a solution that benefits everyone. I hate people that are like that... but I can't say I'm too surprised. A company is going to do what a company is going to do.

This blackout isn't getting anywhere, sadly. Maybe it's because of how many subreddits only went down just for two days. Maybe it's because the CEO has the stick so far up his ass that he doesn't want to change anything. Maybe it's because the company is changing, and not in a way that allows the same forms of advocation anymore.

Reddit is a platform built on their users, and now they're even taking away the ability to protest changes that you made without good review or notification to the people it affects. How is that at all fair?

And so, if nothing changes by July 1st, I'm leaving the platform. Deleting my account and all, and maybe even convince the other PojavLauncher developers to close the subreddit permanently. That's what it's currently at already anyway.

It's disappointing though, Reddit was a great place to find information from multiple sources, share ideas, stuff like that if you looked in the good places. Now it's just going to be another corporate money grab.

If you Apollo users want another way to support Selig, you should check out his Pixel Pals app. On macOS Sonoma it's nice to have the little buddy running around in one of the widgets on my desktop. When I can I'll be subscribing to the paid tier, just to say thanks for many years of development on a great app.
