"Damn it!"

Her hand slammed down on the aging wood of the workbench as her monitor's screen filled with runtime errors. Rolling up her sleeves, she looked at her watch, noticing that a few hours has passed by without much progress.

Her hand drifted back to the trackpad and scrolled through the messages to find the culprit. "It's that same framework every time," she whined, dropping her head to her hands and kicking her foot. "Every. Single. Time."

She began to flip between windows, splitting code and setting breakpoints to find where her issues lie. "Maybe I used an incorrect struct... or this class isn't being retained long enough?"

She looked around at her surroundings. Rotten wood beams? Check. Rusting metal roof? Check. Smell of gasoline and engine oil? Check. Even small details she could point and name with her eyes closed, after being stuck in here for four years.

On her own. No one to call for help. No one to understand...

She looked back at the project, stepping towards the wall it was mounted on. Intricate mechanical parts making up various subsystems that became part of the bigger picture.

"I have to get you working..." She set one hand on an uncovered metallic shoulder.

"I need you... EVA."
