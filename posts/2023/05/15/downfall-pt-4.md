# Downfall, part 4

And here's my personal reaction to each member of that voice chat last night. Get ready for hot takes.

## gusbuncedev

All I can really say here is that I fucking knew it. I knew from the start he was bad news, and that he was going to misuse his powers. Like I said before, I mentioned multiple times that he was not fit to be a manager, and maybe not even fit to be staff at all. If he was a builder, maybe that would have been okay.

Not as a Network manager, though. This is ridiculously unprofessional, incredibility immature, and it just goes to show that he's a fucking incompetent sack of shit.

## Shradinx and Necromancer

These two I was not expecting to turn into... THAT. They were around since day one as well and were nothing but rigid rule followers that would even get on my back if I did something wrong. What the fuck? How did they so easily lie about who they were to every single one of us?

Either way, fuck you two. You and Gus turned a perfectly good project into a pile of rubble simply because you could.

## Cart

I'm in the middle with Cart because... it was his fault but I have to remember that he's just a kid. That doesn't mean he isn't free of blame - he did nothing. He chatted while it was going on. He didn't tell anyone until someone screenshotted and sent it in, and he didn't handle moderation and containment well afterwards.

But, on the other hand, XRCraft was his passion project. This is something he loved coming to every single day to work on and tinker with and see people enjoying in some capacity. He loved the work even when he was getting yelled at by his superiors and even when Bisect was looming over our heads.

But when I said "he's just a kid earlier," that factors in with the overbearing personality of Gus and Shradinx. They both have stepped out of line before and made him feel small (even if not directly!) and acted like they were higher power than him. If I were in that situation, I know I would have shut down and just stood by too. I can't rule out that possibility.

So I am mad at him for doing nothing. But I still feel sorry because he's... really lost everything. Servers are gone. Project is gone. Banned from the places he wants to be in. And he's lost friends too. What he did isn't as severe as what the other three did, and yet he's getting hit so much harder because of it.

That's fucked up, if you ask me.

Those are my thoughts on the five people in the voice chat, and I think these posts accomplished the goal of laying out what exactly happen so that people don't assume what happened. A fucked up series of events that could have effects on everyone involved for a long time to come, even after XRCraft is completely gone.
