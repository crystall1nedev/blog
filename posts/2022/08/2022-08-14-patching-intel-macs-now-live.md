# Patching Intel Macs: Now Live!

It’s time to unsheathe your legacy Macs and come along for the ride into patching Intel-based Macs!

This mini-series starts off with getting to know some of the internals for macOS and what to patch when dealing with legacy Macs. We explored the XNU kernel architecture and found out what each part does, and had a glance at a few components that need to be dealt with when patching a Mac.

Next video, I’ll be taking you with me through the history of patching Mac OS X for unsupported systems.

See you then!
