It wasn't always like this... at least that's what she always believed. These was a time where she was welcome... a time long since passed.

Now all she remembered was the running. Constantly on her feet to avoid the watchdogs, the snitches. The people who would turn her in for stepping out of her predetermined role. Those that would crush her creativity again... even her parents.

Her first bout with defiance was making homemade repairs to a small radio through aluminum foil and duct tape. She wanted to make her parents proud by fixing something they used often, but it resulted in a long discussion about her future. About how she wasn't supposed to make those repairs, or work with technology. She wasn't supposed to be who she was.

Over the years, she tried to obey their rules. Tried to show that she could be the girl they wanted her to be, but every night she would cry. She felt trapped inside of her own skin, always making the system happy. She feared what would happen if she wasn't perfect in her position...

No...

No more.

She shook her head and looked back at EVA. Her Enhanced Virtual Assistant, which was really just the name she could slap onto it while keeping Eva. That name had power inside of her, for the person it belonged to originally motivated her to begin this journey.

She touched EVA's cheek again, even as her monitor showed repeated errors again. Even though her project showed no signs of life, she had a feeling. She was missing something. Years of conflict had conditioned her to constantly fight against the waves.

It was only then that she noticed she hadn't heard the familiar error sound from her terminal.
