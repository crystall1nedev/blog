# The downfall of XRCraft

I'm not sure I can show just how frustrated I am. How frustrated QCXR is, how frustrated the media manager is, how frustrated the staff with a brain are.

These posts are about XRCraft. More specifically, what went wrong, why it shut down, and really a way for me to vent about it.

## Before the events

I want to add a little bit of backstory to help gauge where things were headed before everything went bad last night. It was already in a rough shape - these were the nails in its coffin.

### Warnings from Bisect

The reason XRCraft existed was because BisectHosting had partnered with the QCXR team to give them two very powerful servers. Those servers powered the iteration of XRCraft I started working on with the team since around day one. However, the deal was that Bisect wanted a certain amount of concurrent registrations for it to be profitable. Not enough registrations and XRCraft would have been canned.

They had already warned the team about it, because the numbers weren't high enough. This was a wake up call to get their shit together and start working on something for real, and not just treat XRCraft as a side project that can be benched.

### Maturity of team members

I can't believe I really have to put this here, but this was in fact an issue. While XRCraft was legally, technically run by a bunch of kids, they could have acted a little more adult.

The main one I'm talking about is gusbuncedev, the (former) Network Manager in control of managing teams and web development. While he got the work done, he would constantly make unsettling remarks in voice chats with other team members, mainly sexual that were just... eeeckk. If this were a truly professional environment, he would have been fired.

Additionally, there was Shradinx. While he wasn't necessary immature, he would overstep his bounds and act like he owned the place. There were various times that he would skirt past the hierarchy and go directly to Cart instead of an admin. I warned him multiple times about it too.

The thing that makes them immature is how they never listened.

### Incorrect power structure

I said multiple times that we needed to consolidate the hierarchy of roles so that it would be easier to manage. I also said multiple times that Gus had no reason to be a Network Manager, even during the limited time of Gus and I both being Network Managers. It's on me for not paying much attention to XRCraft and getting demoted because of that, leaving just Gus in that position.

We also had too many heads leading each other around, and it got confusing a lot of the time. I wasn't sure who to talk to about X because there was three different roles for it, that kind of thing. This handicapped us heavily because no one knew who the fuck was supposed to do what.

### Departure from XRCraft

In the past week, there have been two people who left the XRCraft staff team in some way: CADIndie and me.

We left for basically the same reasons, for personal reasons that we couldn't continue. I ended my administration on the spot, but agreed to help out with anything development related if I was willing to. I still have staff access because of how much I had done for the server since it first started. This was Saturday night, by the way.

And only about... 18 hours later, CADIndie announced that after the big XRCraft event was all finished, he and the rest of QCXR would leave it entirely since it was not a project he wanted to work on anymore, due to the mismanagement of resources and said personal issues.

With CAD and I gone and most of the QCXR admins not paying attention, that left the control to those who should not have had it, and left them alone to each other, which turned out to be the biggest mistake of all.

**This post is going to be too long in just one so I'm splitting it up into many (probably just two, maybe three).**
