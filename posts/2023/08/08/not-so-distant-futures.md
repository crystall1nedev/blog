# The not-so-distant futures.

It's crazy how fast time passes. How three months can go by without you even realizing it. As a little bit of a continuation to the last post about the Safehouse, I wanted to write something about my future. About the Safehouse's future, and Stella's future. About how suddenly everything changed, about why I haven't been doing anything outside of Discord, about a lot of things.

The original plan was that I would go to college. I would stay for a semester and then move out with my sibling to Colorado, where I would unite with Stella and we could plan things out together. Maybe end up in CalTech, and figure out what to do then.

Nah. Things changed.

I knew that I needed to get Stella out of her parent's house and their tight grip over her, because it was turning into a toxic environment. That's the whole reason I [made a post for them](https://crystall1ne.dev/2023/05/18/to-stellas-parents/). The amount of shit I heard her having to deal with was getting to a limit in my mind, and after a while I couldn't handle it anymore.

So on April 5th, when she came home from yet another weary and painful day of work, I told her. I will drop my college courses and take a gap year, just to make sure that we can get into a safe space. Away from her family that is suppressing her ability to be herself. Away from my family who might think I'm making a mistake.

This is a lot to process, but it's in motion. We're collecting money and selling anything we don't absolutely need in order to make up for it. And... this brings me to the other part of this post.

I haven't been able to work on videos, or OpenCore Legacy Patcher stuff, or much of anything due to a lack of motivation. I just... couldn't get off of my ass and start fighting through the weakness, and that hit super hard these past few weeks. I felt like failing again, because of college expenses and financial aid, small mistakes made along the way that put me into a hole I wanted to get out of.

But now, things have changed. I've dropped my college courses so I don't get charged. And the plan is to work for this year to get everything I can collected, save it up, make it count. Make it possible for Stella and I to live together and have the jobs that we want to have.

And right now, I'm doing whatever it takes to accomplish that. I'm even selling the 16-inch MacBook Pro I spent a year getting through keyboard replacements from Apple, because that will cover rent for a whole month, plus a security deposit, and leave some money left over for food and utilities.

To make things better, CADIndie of QuestCraft is joining us in our adventure into the adult world. A few hours ago he revealed that, after QuestCraft his LTS status, he's going to cease his role as a developer and focus on other projects, and his future. With his help, Stella and I have more of a chance to accomplish the goals we've been setting for ourselves, and we'll all be able to learn from each other.

I'm not sure where we will end up - probably in Michigan due to the cost of living and benefits for LGBT Americans that the governor has been fighting for. And I'm sure that unexpected things will happen - but I'm excited. I'm ready to start this next chapter of life (even if it's just getting an apartment and working for a year while I work everything out) with this renewed motivation and sense of... passion.

Stella is my top priority, because without her, there would have been no Eva Isabella Luna. I love her to death and back, and even if we're suffering, I'll be somewhat happy knowing that we'd be together for that. And getting help from CADIndie while we do this just adds a cherry on top - he's proven to be a very close friend and we can confide in each other pretty well.

I would also like to thank anyone that's giving us money during this, it means a lot. Scrub.jpg gave Stella a pretty hefty amount on PayPal earlier and that's super helpful for our plans. And everyone supporting me on Patreon even though I haven't done much to give back - I'm working on something that I hope will repay these debts (even if you nerds say that you would just unsub if you we unhappy with it, I feel bad.)

As for my current projects? I need to put those on hold for a little bit. At least until the three of us are settled in an apartment and capable of sustaining it. I only anticipate to be inactive for another month or so, but I can't promise this.

All I can really say is that I'm going to be coming back with a renewed spirit, a happier face, and the ability to focus more.

I'll wrap up the lore posts while the move is going on though - Stella and I have something good going, and more on the way!
