# The Sanctuary

As a bit of a break between lore posts (that are actually hitting pretty hard because of the meaning behind them), I wanted to make a post about the status of my Discord server: the Safehouse.

There's a reason it's named that way, and it stems from the first attempt at a Discord server. That one failed because of its connection to r/jailbreak and my inability to separate the two. But this one...

We've built something special. Even people that one had a few days to be able to look around understood that... and it's never really been that big of a deal until today.

Our resolves have been tested over the past few weeks, and it's just because of various issues we've got going on in our lives. Perfectly normal behavior because of how society works.

The special thing is how we're always able to go into the Safehouse and talk about it, but not just that. We can lift each other up too. We support each other even when we take huge hits.

I've left the OpenCore Legacy Patcher Discord multiple times because I felt like I wasn't doing enough, or I was pissing the developers off. And every single time, someone has been there to tell me I was wrong. And I've seen instances of this elsewhere in that server. People telling each other that things aren't always going to be okay. But that we have each other's shoulders to cry on if needed.

Back in January, when I did those posts about how I ended up in a psych ward from attempted suicide, I said a friend called 911.

That friend was in the Safehouse. They all were when they were telling her to call 911 for me.

To see how much the Safehouse has turned into a place of wonder, of sanctuary, of lvoe and cherishment for each of our members. To see that they're talking about how it brightens up their days even when they aren't in the mood for that. It's truly amazing... and I'm so thankful for everyone in there for making it what it is today.

I'm thankful for all of the memories, the trash talking, the jokes, the crying, the everything. It's been a wonderful just-over-a-year since the Safehouse began, and I hope to see more people come build an even stronger community.
