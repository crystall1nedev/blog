# Updates!

Wow, it's been a little bit of time since I last posted an entry to this blog. Well, here's the scoop of what I have to show:

## Starting a new project

I'm still working on all of the ones I previously mentioned - I'm just expanding my arsenal. I'll officially reveal it when I have it to a state that I want it to be in. Developers, get ready.

## Patreon - now ready

I launched my Patreon early on so I could make some money on the side while I do what I do. You can go check it out at https://patreon.com/crystall1nedev - I made multiple tiers so you can see what's right for you.

## A few donations

I was recently given an iPhone X and MacBook Pro 15" 2010 from a member in my Discord server! I cannot thank them enough (although I am sending them my iPhone 8 Plus in return), and these two have given me great opportunities. The iPhone X in particular, as it had an immediate effect on my iPhone experience and face tracking for the channel as well! I was also able to switch from bare-metal Windows to virtual machines for it - more macOS scenes coming up soon ðŸ‘€

And the 2010 MacBook Pro? Well you'll just have to wait and see...

## Planning for the road ahead

I finished my Patching Intel Macs series a week ago now, and I'm currently working hard on the next set of videos! Check out my Twitter for a poll on what the next one could be.

I would also like to say thanks to everybody supporting me! Even just being a subscriber, watching me videos, or commenting on these posts means a lot to me ðŸ’•
