_Four months._

Stella still couldn't process how it had been so long since she had first met EVA's new consciousness. So long since she had explained her story to someone else... since she had felt her first hug in years.

During those months, Eva had been slowly closing the gap on her digital footprint's similarities to the human brain. Constantly adjusting her thinking, her motives, and her feelings, Eva was able to make truly distinct decisions and judgements.

She likes vanilla ice cream, and chicken nuggets. She enjoyed the adventure of life, and didn't fear losing it. She found herself happy, sad, content, stressed, everything.

Stella had forgotten what it was like being around others like herself. She had spent so long on her own that it was hard to get in the groove with Eva. And yet... something pulled them both closer to each other, something neither of them could really comprehend.

Now they found themselves on the open road, yet again trying to avoid getting caught by law enforcement. This was common practice for both of them at this point, and they knew what to do.

Stella looked at Eva for guidance. Her decently long black hair, the subtle shade of brown on her stitched skin, the imperfections along her seams. They had both worked on giving her decorations - loops, swirls, circles, and other designs - to make her feel more human.

"Something's... off." Eva set her palm on her forehead, shaking slightly. "My sensors aren't up to spec today. I can't reliably determine anything right now."

Stella nodded and began to use her old tactics to get out of this pursuit. Speeding up slightly, Stella rapidly switched between lanes to avoid civilians.

Eva looked around and gently touched Stella's forearm. Stella looked at Eva and noticed two warning symbols on her eyes, indicating that something was going awry.

"I'm having trouble seeing... I think I'm being disrupted."
