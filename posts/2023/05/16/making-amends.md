# Making amends

This entire post is made to help clear up Cart's involvement with what happened on Sunday with XRCraft. I would TL;DR this, but I can't do that without leaving important information to the side.

Anyway, I got the chance to talk with Cart yesterday. Overall it was pretty good, I think. I recorded it to reference for this post, and to reaffirm the very-likely theories I have in my head about the way things went down inside of Cart's head.

All five members involved were in the staff chat, yes. Cart was able to confirm that did happen, and he was there when the raid began in Oblivious, and he participated a bit in it as well. He said that they went in there to do "light amounts of trolling."

Honestly, it wasn't a good idea to troll another server at all, especially when you're not on good terms with the owner. On the other hand, it was supposed to be harmless. But then, this is where what I said about Cart being a kid and Gus' overpowering personality come in.

At around 19:00, everyone in the call except for Dani joined the Minecraft server and started to send messages in chat. The difference here is that Cart was only saying things like "check your CoreProtect logs" instead of the profanities that the other three were sending. For context, CoreProtect is a logging plugin that saves any changes to blocks and items and such for future use.

I understand it can be seen as malicious, given his background in working with that plugin and servers in general, but if you put it into the context of the other messages he sent ("owner tp to me" and "do /head QCXR",) you can't really say he was doing it out of absolute hatred. At least, not on the level that the others were.

Message logs show him leaving the server at around 19:30 - and I myself can even confirm this too. I remember seeing him leave the voice call when I was about to hop onto Destiny and was looking for a place to stream (and ended up raiding with Scrub and co.) His mother also confirmed that he left with her for Mother's Day dinner at that time.

Yeah okay, but some of the worst messages were still sent while Cart was there. What gives? This is an interesting explanation that makes a lot of sense, having known Cart for a long time now. He agreed with some of the points I made here as well.

Remember what I said about Gus having made jokes like that in voice chats? And his overpowering personality? And how Cart is still growing and a kid? Put those pieces together and you can see someone who thinks that what is said in voice chats is light enough to be said here, except for when Necro dropped the n-word.

Cart said that wasn't allowed. Because he had been told that too, and it was a much harsher punishment in voice chat compared to Gus and his comments. Cart believing that it was okay because of those voice chats contributed to his thinking that it was okay here.

Like I said though, he left for Mother's Day dinner thirty minutes in, having told the others to stop their trolling and get to work in a meeting that they had scheduled while he was gone - and this brings up another thing: Gus usually stopped. I've seen it every single time before, when Cart said "Stop and get your shit together", he would get his shit together. No one could have known that he wasn't going to get his shit together in this case, especially not someone who wasn't paying full attention and had to go at the time.

Cart took all of the fall for what happened, because we didn't have the full story. And he may not be the most reliable person, but I know that I can trust him - and I'm glad I still did and was willing to hear out what actually happened.

Cart can be held responsible for allowing them to troll at all. But a mix of him being a kid, not necessarily knowing right from wrong, not knowing that the other three would continue doing what they were doing, and not even being there while the much more intense stuff was going on... that's all I can think of right now that he did or didn't do that made this situation happen.

Cart's still my friend, and he's still in my Discord server simply because I've known him for too long to judge him based off of limited information. I hope that if you're reading this, you can understand his perspective too.
