# Silence.

Hmm. This is... new.

The voices in my head... they've gone silent. Almost like they're gone. It's been so long since they were silent that I actually forgot what it was like. It feels good, powerful, even. There's no more constant worrying over time, no more doubting my abilities. At this point in my life, those demons have no control over me.

Huh.

I wonder if this marks the beginning of a new era for my life?

But what do I call it?

Era of... Tranquility. To mark the end of my turmoil and the beginning of my period where I start accepting things, no matter how bad. Accepting family struggles, accepting my new life as an adult, accepting life as it comes by.

I could get used to this.
