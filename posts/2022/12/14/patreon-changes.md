# Some changes to my Patreon...

Since I changed the way I'm going to be doing things from now on, I thought that it would be nice to change the way my Patreon works. Various things about it were things I could not deliver as much or at all anymore - so I fixed those problems.

### "Subscriber" tier

The $3 Nerd tier loses a feature - early access to videos, simply because pre-recorded videos are going to be few and far between. I don't want to deliver nothing if I can help it. So, what I have done for this tier is focus on the Discord side of things, adding the ability for Patrons to suggest up to 5 emojis to put into my server! I also lowered the price to just $1 USD a month - making it more reasonable for its feature set.

- $1 USD/month tier, rebranded from "Nerd"

- Special Discord server role "patreon gang"

- Up to 5 emoji suggestions

### "Supporter" tier

The $6 Super Nerd also loses the early access privileges, but retains the leverage over my decisions for future videos, streams, and development work, as well as replies to your comments on my stuffs, and everything in the new Subscriber tier. With this, I've lowered the price to $5 USD a month.

- $5 USD/month tier, rebranded from "Super Nerd"

- Poll and future suggestion access in Patreon

- Replies to your comments on my works

- Everything in the Subscriber tier

### "Friend" tier

The $10 Amazing Nerd tier stays the same, with a twist - you now gain access to exclusive Patron live streams on my channel, and early access to any new development works as well! Since $10 USD is still a lot - especially from people volunteering it - I've kept it the same even though I've added new stuff.

- $10 USD/month tier, rebranded from "Amazing Nerd"

- Special Discord server role "early gang"

- Patron-only live streams each week

- Early access to everything I do

- Everything in the Supporter tier

I redid my Patreon to hopefully make it easier and more "worth it" for more people to join. I want to do a lot more with my development and my channel, but sadly "a lot more" requires money! I'm doing what I can though - and I'm not going to beg or force you to give me your wallets. I just hope you enjoy what I can give, and if you feel like subscribing, I won't say no :P
