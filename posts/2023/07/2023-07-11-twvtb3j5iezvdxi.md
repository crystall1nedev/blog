The next few hours were spent looking over her shoulder at every turn, just to make sure the police weren't still following her. The adrenaline-fueled rush she had first felt when they arrived was beginning to wear off with every look of emptiness behind her, returning to her resting state of stress and anxiety.

While it was a dangerous bet to make, she decided to head towards the city. It was her only way of finding the power to fuel her pet project, outside of the barn which was probably now unsafe. Like everywhere else.

She pulled off into a back alley and parked behind a trash can, just small enough to fit her Jeep and conceal it from people looking for it. conceal it enough for her to be able to let her palms drop from the steering wheel and her forehead to collapse into it.

This is what it was like for her, constantly. Settle somewhere, get found, run, repeat. It was the same tune, so she didn't cry this time. She was just determined to change the way people lived their lives, undo that aspect of control.

She pulled out her laptop and set it on the stand in the center console, quickly tapping to enter her password and reopen various windows. She glanced at EVA, still motionless... dead... but...

Her terminal showed something else. The unknown force helping her before had followed her here the entire time, and it has somehow managed to iron out enough of the core programming to enable-

"EVA?" She said to herself, slowly dragging a window across the screen. Its contents showed various systems had undergone testing to verify they still worked, sensors were being calibrated, new code was being added with the blink of an eye.

"That's not possible for any human to do..." She looked at EVA. "But it's possible for you." She typed out a few commands to open a connection between EVA's kernel and her terminal. She knew who the unknown force was now, but only one thing was needed to confirm it-

```
> I've been waiting for you. 
```

Her eyes widened with the gravity of this discovery. The unknown force helping to finish the EVA project wasn't a good samaritan that hacked her, or another person at all. It was EVA's core programming, that very same framework she was fighting against during compilation earlier.

"We did it, Eva..." Only this time, she was referring to the person who helped begin this long journey. One of the only people she had ever trusted before... her best friend.

She set both of her hands on the keyboard, and began to type.
