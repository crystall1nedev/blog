# My undertermined future

I'm at a conflict right now. Too much going on and I'm kinda too tired to deal with it (both figuratively and literally as I also didn't get much sleep last night.) Probably because of this thing that's been lingering over the past few weeks.

There's been a thing going on with PojavLauncher that I just can't agree with: offline mode.

We removed this feature after Microsoft _literally sent me a takedown request._ Yeah, for those who didn't know that Microsoft DMCA'd my iOS repository in 2021, now you do.

On the iOS side, we got rid of it quickly and it's still gone. On the Android side, it took a while to remove it, and they reimplemented it by refactoring the code. It's been a while since that happened and they still aren't willing to fix it because they would lose some of the community.

It's disappointing to see how the safety of the project - and even one of the developers - is not a priority compared to how many people use the launcher, especially when I'm not the oldest or most experienced one on the team. I realize I haven't always been the nicest team member to deal with, but they're letting me deal with the repercussions of their actions.

And that's not fair. It's not.

So I've been debating whether or not I should just leave the team. If I'm not working on it, I won't have to deal with it. But the issue is that I'm so deeply connected on the iOS side, and DuyKhanhTran already has enough to deal with as a project manager and developer of two completely different versions.

And then there's just the fact that I don't want to leave. I like working on PojavLauncher because it helps me feel like I'm a good developer and I know what I'm doing. PojavLauncher was the first public project that I actively began working on, too. I'd be throwing that away because of stupidity from other people, having to give up what I like to do because they turned it into a crime.

I don't know, right now. I want to work on it but the thought of getting Microsoft on my back again is just too much to handle at this point in my life.

I have been spending time with side projects with some of the QuestCraft staff (mainly CADIndie, the project manager), just to get my mind off of it and sharpen up on my Swift. At least I know I'll have those to look forward to if I leave PojavLauncher.

I think.
