# Updated plans for my streams

I've been hard at work behind the scenes of my YouTube channel - even though it's been over a month since I posted my returning video (because I also have a personal life and those kinds of things to deal with while I'm editing and scripting and all of that cool stuff.)

However, I know that I want to stream someday, so this Friday is looking to be on for that plan. This time around, I'm gonna be trying something a little bit different - and it's not limited to something that you'll hear about in a future video that I'm cranking out.

No, it's actually got to do with the actual content of the video. Yes, I will likely still be playing games and such, and depending on availability it will probably be with Scrub.jpg and company. However, my Discord server is such an interesting place to be in, and I want to start including those members in my channel as much as I can, mainly because that server has given me the world for over a year now.

So, if there's nothing to be done with Scrub and Co, I'll be hanging out in my general voice chat with my people in there. Give them the opportunity to speak up and have us have fun on a stream, nerd out, everything. Adding that little extra community bit just feels right to me, so that's how it's gonna go!

So, yes, stream on Friday, usual time of 7PM ET. Expect more stuff to be different with this one!
