# Shutting down my repo.

Well, it's time! https://repository.crystall1ne.software is shutting down today. This post is brief, but covering where to get your stuff after my repo is gone.

The following will be available on their respective GitHub repositories:

- PojavLauncher

- PojavOptimize

- jetsamctl

- OpenJDK 8

- OpenJDK 16

The following will no longer be available for download:

- overb0ard

- echob@t

- SafariFloatingTabBar

I can't do this immediately, so it will happen in a few hours. It's been fun with you jailbreakers, and I hope to see you around.
