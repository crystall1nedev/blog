Four years ago, things were different. She always thought about this, because they really were. She wasn't completely alone in her journey, even though she liked to try and believe that now. She had someone else; she had Eva.

Not the robot girl EVA, but the real human being Eva. They were both nerds, hiding things from everyone else but each other. Working on small programs to prank their teachers anonymously, having long talks about the state of the world, doing what regular kids would have done in the past.

Eva was even there when she first ran away from home to escape the tyranny - they both ran together. They combined their brain power to create code, laugh everything off, make plans. Make the plan that she would be continuing now, where they would end the tyranny. Bring back the freedom of choice.

It was three years ago, though, that things changed. They were formulating a plan in a public space - something they both knew was a risky bet. Trying to work on it with other people was a riskier one, but they had to. No other option for what they needed to get done in this case.

The bear trap was set. The one made out of pure hatred and cruelty, to create an example out of those who were defiant. The one that sprang when their contact revealed himself to be an undercover agent of the law.

She tries to block this night out of her memory, but it always comes back. It always returns.

The hurried scramble. The bullets coming through the windows. The familiar sirens. The scraping metal through slamming vehicles. The spike strip, and then-

Rolling. Tumbling down the hill into the forest below. Glass flying everywhere and cutting them like rosebushes, the metal creaking and slamming around their bodies like ragdolls. The smell of gasoline dripping to the ground as they lay trapped in the seat by their buckles.

She was the first one out of the wreckage of the car. A nasty gash on her side from a twisted piece of door, and blood running from her scalp. She was disoriented, but not enough to cloud her from her goal.

She held her side and felt the warm blood on her fingers as she stumbled to the other door, setting her hand on it and taking a quick breath. Eva was squirming only slightly, a noticeable piece of debris pinning her to the upholstery of the seat through her abdomen.

They both had a small argument over getting her out in the span of a minute. Like their other arguments, Eva managed to get the upper hand, even if it was the more dangerous option. But this... this was more than dangerous. This was death.

All she gave was her backpack with her laptop and research notes, as well as a last goodbye.

"Don't cry for me, Stella." Eva wheezed, taking Stella's hand. "Take everything we've built and make it better. Bring this mission to its end... and don't let anything stand in your way."

Stella's cheeks were drenched with her tears as she put on the backpack and held her side again. She slowly let Eva's fingers go as Eva's other hand raised her pistol, and aimed in the direction of their pursuers.

"I can take some of them out to buy you time," She looked at the magazine, and reloaded it. "and when I get overwhelmed... you better be out of my sight."

Stella limped away, clutching trees as she passed them. When she heard the first gunshot, she shut her eyes and started to run, the tears coming down her cheeks like rain. The pain growing in her heart overpowered the physical pain of the crash, knowing that her friend... her companion... her-

Bang.

When Stella heard the final gunshot, she was out of sight. She settled inside of a small cave nearby, her body wounded and her heart shattered.
