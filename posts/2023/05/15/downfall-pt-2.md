# Downfall, part 2

\-and now we're onto the guts.

This one has a trigger warning, don't read on if you can't handle reading the n-word, Nazi shit, pedophilia, rape.

## What actually happened?

Well, here's what I have been able to gather from pretty much everyone involved and my own research.

There were five people in the Staff voice chat of XRCraft last night:

- Cartrigger, the owner of the server

- Gus, Network Manager and Web Developer

- Shradinx, Senior Moderator

- Necromancer, Senior Moderator, Builder Manager, Maintainer of Economy

- WolfKingVT, Senior Moderator (also known as "Dani")

_Note: While Cart and Dani were in the voice chat, neither one of them talked much or followed through with what came after._

### The setup

Gus, Shradinx, and Necro were talking about banned members of XRCraft... for some reason. This led to them either learning or talking about the fact that a banned member was running a server that "competed" with XRCraft - named the Oblivious Network. It hadn't seen a lot of players because XRCraft was still the dominating force, but those three managed to find a way to get the Discord invite link from a server member.

### The raid

The three entered the Discord and joined the Minecraft server network itself, venturing into survival where the players were. And... at 19:15 EST, Necro started it off with the n-word.

Then all three began the raid, spamming n-words, Nazi shit, pedophilia, even going as far as to make comments about raping members of the server. And remember, this is all just because the user was banned from XRCraft. No actual reason behind it other than that.

One of the server members standing by took a screenshot and sent it to the QCXR staff, which then lead to sdpixl quickly locking down XRCraft itself, stating that QCXR was no longer a part of it, nor would they endorse or interact with the staff team because of what had just happened.

Gus came into the Staff chats and began to spew incredibly violent remarks about killing members if they pinged Shradinx for moderation, and then changed his name and logged off of Discord to not be banned.

Shradinx left the servers and sent out and apology letter to various staff members shortly afterwards, however upon reading that I can say with confidence that it's a load of bullshit.

And Necro? I'm not sure what he did after. I just know he was banned.
