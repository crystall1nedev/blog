# Exciting things!

This post is actually about PojavLauncher, the Minecraft: Java Edition launcher I work on for iOS and Android. I'm an iOS girl, so I only work on the iOS port, but I still have exciting things to share.

So, to start off: PojavLauncher 2.1 is releasing! It's been a while, but now we know it's hitting the shelves on **December 10th, 2022!** We also worked with the AltStore and SideStore people to make it a trusted source - so you can grab it ASAP and download it the easy way on day one.

We decided to release on a date in the future to give us extra time to finish a few other projects, including the revamped PojavLauncher website, which is actually going really well in terms of activity.

It also helps us wrap up our development of 2.1, by collecting information to kill bugs fast. This led to our decision to also make **release candidates** before the official drop - just so we can be bombarded with bug reports so we can fix everything we need to!

The first release candidate drops on **November 12, 2022!** It will be what we consider "done", and compiled as a regular release. Make sure to enable debug logging in Settings before adventuring for issues and try to get us as much as you can - we'd love to improve the experience for you.

Happy testing!
