Oh hey - you've stumbled across my posts site. This is where I drop my thoughts, quick tutorials, updates, and the rest - and serves as an outlet for the history of the other EVA. I try to post as often as possible here, but I'm way more active over in [The Sanctuary](https://discord.crystall1ne.dev).

## The timeline of (the original) Eva Luna
Keeping track of the events in my life is complicated, and my brain likes to forget. As a way to remind myself of my past, I keep it here.

::: tip Ordering of the timeline

The timeline is listed in reverse chronological order - events that are new are listed at the top, with the oldest at the bottom. Only the currently active Era will be shown by default - you can scroll down to see past Eras underneath!

### Era of Survival
Taking ourselves and our belongings to Colorado, I'm navigating a completely new world. Riddled by mental problems, I fight to stay standing, respect my lost friends, tell untold stories, and defeat my old demons.

The current era of my life is one of complexity. I'm navigating life as an adult, with many people backing my and pushing me forward - aided by Stella. It's strange, finally being able to spread my wings and be myself to the fullest.

Chiara passed away from COVID-19 in mid 2020, completely knocking me out of the water and into my own tears. I struggled to keep my head up and continue with even basic activities... it all felt pointless as I got lower and lower.

When I moved out of California in April of 2017, I felt alone. I kept ties with those I called friends in California, but it was nothing like having them in person. I struggles to fit in... I couldn't find where I belonged.

This was one of the darkest times of my life... but I didn't know it was about to get even worse.

::: details Era of Ignorance
**Period:** March 2005 - November 2014  
**Playlist:** Not available...  

The first "era" of my life would spark the beginning of my journey into development and life. I call it the Era of Ignorance because I was unaware of the broader world, and my own inner self. 

Surprisingly, this era of my life isn't one that had much activity. It would take almost a decade for things to begin ramping up...
